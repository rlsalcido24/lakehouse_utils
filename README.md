# springbricks

springbricks is an initiative to automate dbt + snowflake model builds to dbt + databricks with minimal refactoring. This is done through dbt macros. The relevant macros are in the macros folder. Assuming dbt is intalled locally, execute dbt run and witness the comilation that is done under the hood! The sample model leverages 3 of the example macros but feel free to test with any of the ~60 that are currently available!
