### lakehouse_utils:

The purpose of the lakehouse utils package is threefold: 

I) Expedite the time and level of effort for migrating pipelines from cloud data warehouses to the Lakehouse  (ie dbt + databricks). This is done by transpiling functions that are not natively available in spark sql to compatible spark sql functions that take in the same input(s) and render the same outputs. This is done via either DBT macros (feel free to reference the macros directory) or in place regex conversions.  

II) Be a centralized source of truth for warehouse function mapping to Databricks function mapping. Also surface instances where certain functions can not be automated and manual intervention is required. You can find the full list of supported functions in the functionlist.csv in the seed directory; you can also find further information in the read.me in the macros directory.  

III) Surface best practices around unit tests to instill confidence that the macros are robust and reliable (feel free to reference the tests directory). 

### Installation instructions:

I) Include this package in your packages.yml â€” check [here](https://github.com/rlsalcido24/lakehouse_utils/releases/tag/v1.0.1) for the latest version number.

II) Run dbt deps

III) Execute dbt seed -- this project includes a CSV that must be seeded for automated transpilation.

### Database support:

This package has been tested on Snowflake, Redshift, and Databricks.

### Manual 'Hello World' CUJ:  

To get a quick sense of what this module offers, you can reference and run the models in the models directory. Here are the relevant steps:  

I) Insert the relevant values into the profiles.yml based on your warehouse and lakehouse credentials.

II) Build the Snowflake models by executing dbt run --target snow and the Redshift models by executing dbt run --target redshift.

III) Build the Databricks models by temporarily updating the models_path key in profiles.yml to be tmp/snowflake or tmp/redshift and executing dbt run --target databricks.

IV) Observe that when when the models build on Databricks they transpile the Snowflake/Redshift functions that invoke macros (wrapped in curly braces). Also observe that while syntax is slightly different in each system the end results are still the same. Also note that manually 'migrating' these two models from scratch should take no longer than 5 mins-- it is just a matter of wrapping the relevant function in braces and wrapping the input parameters in quotes. 

### Automated 'to the moon' CUJ 

I) Create a seperate dev branch of your dbt project. Execute dbt seed (if you haven't already). Run the helper convert_to_databricks.py file (either locally or within Databricks). Obvserve that all your Snowflake/Redshift models have now been automatically refactored to reference relevant macros, therefore making it possible to build these models in Databricks.

II) dbt run.

III) Execute unit tests to ensure that the models built in Databricks match the models built on Snowflake/Redshift.

IV) Once you have sufficient confidence merge the dev branch into master and update your dbt run to refrence the transpiled logic. 

V) Build models in both systems until sufficient confidence is instilled to run the models solely on one system.

### Local Version - Databricks Converter locally

There is also a convert_to_databricks python file that can convert the models in place in a local environment. 

This function also contains additional abilities such as:

I) Ability to configure and inject arbitrary regex syntax mappings source_pattern --> target_pattern.
II) Ability to write out converted results to separate folder
III) Ability to run as a package or standalone locally
IV) Ability execute locally without needing to connect or import into Databricks for conversion. 

Example Command:
python3 ./convert_to_databricks.py --sourcedb redshift --dir_path "redshift/" --parse_mode 'all' --parse_first 'syntax'

For the full list of avail vars, use the --h flag or look at the code base. Other examples also exist in the pierunner doc in the helper directory as well!
